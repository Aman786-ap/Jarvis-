# 🧮 Simple C++ Project

This repository contains a basic C++ project implemented in the file project.cpp. It is designed for educational purposes and demonstrates the use of C++ syntax, standard I/O, and possibly basic logic depending on the implementation.

This project is ideal for beginners who are learning how to structure and run C++ programs from the command line or in an IDE.
